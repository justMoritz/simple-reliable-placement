This short demo was created as a proof of concept to develop a semi-customizable brochure which clients could modify and create, and could go to print with minimal additional input from a design team. 

Ultimately, this project never went anywhere, but I would have enjoyed developing this into a pipeline straight out of and back into Illustrator or InDesign!
